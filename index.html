<br>                    The history of noodles is incredibly long, with the earliest evidence found in China. In 2005, archaeologists uncovered a 4,000-year-old bowl of millet-based noodles at the Lajia archaeological site in northwestern China. This makes them one of the oldest prepared foods in the world. While the discovery solidified China's claim to the earliest noodles, written records also confirm their early importance; the first written mention appears in a Chinese dictionary from the Eastern Han dynasty</p>

                <p class="text-small"><br>Over centuries, noodles spread widely, often adapting to local ingredients and culinary traditions. Early forms of boiled dough products, sometimes called itriyah, existed in the Mediterranean and Middle East by the 5th century A.D. These may have developed independently or been influenced by trade routes, such as the Silk Road, which connected China to the West. The popular—but debated—legend of Marco Polo bringing pasta from China to Italy in the 13th century highlights the historical connection, though firm evidence suggests pasta was already known in Italy by that time, possibly introduced by Arabs via Sicily.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"><br>The noodle's story didn't slow down with the pre-modern era. In the 20th century, a new invention revolutionized global eating: instant noodles. Developed by Momofuku Ando in Japan in 1958, these pre-cooked, dried, and packaged noodles were created as an affordable, quick, and shelf-stable food solution for post-war Japan. Instant ramen rapidly became a global phenomenon, making noodles an accessible and universally loved convenience food, further cementing their status as a global staple.</p>
